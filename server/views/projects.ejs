            <h3>Radio Lighting</h3>
            <p>This is the model that I created using the Simon Fuchs military radio tutorial.
                I wanted to practice new ways of modeling texturing and lighting. Tutorial is incredible and full of information that helped me improve my skills.
                This is my own interpretation of lighting that model.</p>

            <h3>Reaper IR Scope</h3>
            <p>Challenged myself with more complex shapes and forms as well as trying to optimize as best as possible.
                A little light on the damage for this piece as its mostly factory new.
                I enjoyed and learned a ton about optimizing my models to bring them down to a desirable poly count.
                Still a long way to go but this to me is a good first stepping stone.
                Enjoy and look forward to what I can produce in the future!</p>
